# Guide to open source development in the cloud

Enterprises are increasingly using more than one cloud in their IT solutions, a trend that is thanks, in large part, to the fact that most major clouds are built using open source software. An [O'Reilly survey](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/oreilly-open-source-skill-survey-blog/), commissioned by IBM in Fall 2020, pointed out that, when choosing cloud providers, 70% of respondents prefer one based on open source. The survey went on to say:

 > _Developers who want to develop cloud applications should work on honing their open source skills, which underly every major cloud platform, instead of only focusing on building skills for a proprietary cloud_.

The most desirable open source skills are those related to Linux (containers), artificial intelligence and machine learning, and data storage. 

As both the cloud and open source landscapes evolve, we saw a need for a guide to highlight important aspects of hybrid cloud development--and their corresponding open source services.

This goals of this guide are to provide:

1. Comprehensive collection of learnings for open hybrid cloud developers.
2. Content that is cloud-agnostic but highlights how major clouds are using open source.
3. Solutions and content focused on solving use cases that are common to developers.

## What's leading to multi-cloud adoption?

The rise of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud adoption is related to a number of factors, including:

* Multi-cloud is a reality as all clouds have strengths and weaknesses
* Spreading workloads across clouds reduce risks vs a mono-cloud approach
* Using different clouds may reduce costs in long term

> An open hybrid cloud combines and unifies public cloud and private cloud services from multiple cloud vendors to create a single, flexible IT infrastructure, based on open source technologies. Learn more about [What is Hybrid Cloud?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/hybrid-cloud).

## Developer Needs

* Developers have different needs from cloud providers depending on the developerâ€™s experience
* Developers have specific use cases they have to implement
* Developers need a cloud or clouds that do not lock them in
* Developers need a cloud or clouds that will grow with their needs
