# Open Source Cloud Guide

As our [O'Reilly survey](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/oreilly-open-source-skill-survey-blog/) earlier this year pointed out: _Developers who want to develop cloud applications should work on honing their OSS skills (which underly every major cloud platform) instead of only focusing on building skills for a proprietary cloud_. The survey highlighted that the most desired of the open source skills are around Linux (containers), artificial intelligence and machine learning, and data storage. When choosing cloud providers, 70% of respondents prefer one based on open source. (O'Reilly survey).

This goals of this guide are to provide:

1. Comprehensive collection of learnings for open hybrid cloud developers
2. Content that is agnostic of leading public clouds
3. Solutions and content focused on solving use cases that are common to developers

## Cloud Realities

* Multi-cloud is a reality as all clouds have strengths and weaknesses
* Spreading workloads across clouds reduce risks vs a mono-cloud approach
* Using different clouds may reduce costs in long term

> An open hybrid cloud combines and unifies public cloud and private cloud services from multiple cloud vendors to create a single, flexible IT infrastructure, based on open source technologies. Learn more about [What is Hybrid Cloud?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/hybrid-cloud).

## Developer Needs

* Developers have different needs from cloud providers depending on the developerâ€™s experience
* Developers have specific use cases they have to implement
* Developers need a cloud or clouds that do not lock them in
* Developers need a cloud or clouds that will grow with their needs
