# Open Source Cloud Guide

As our O'Reilly survey earlier this year pointed out: Developers who want to develop cloud applications should work on honing their OSS skills (which underly every major cloud platform) instead of only focusing on building skills for a proprietary cloud. The survey highlighted that the most desired of the open source skills are around Linux (containers), artificial intelligence and machine learning, and data storage.

This guide provides a:

* Learning path for developers in the evolving world of open hybrid cloud
* Guidance and an opinion on technologies, cloud services, and tools to use
* Focus presentations on use cases we believe that are common to today’s hybrid cloud developers

When choosing cloud providers, 70% of respondents prefer one based on open source. (O'Reilly survey).

What it is: <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/hybrid-cloud?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=what%20is%20hybrid%20cloud>

An open hybrid cloud combines and unifies public cloud and private cloud services from multiple cloud vendors to create a single, flexible IT infrastructure, which-in the age of cloud data and AI-is based on open source technologies. In fact, almost every major cloud vendor’s container platform is built on Kubernetes-and the containers themselves are being built with other open technologies. (blog)

## Cloud Realities

* Multi-cloud is a reality as all clouds have strengths and weaknesses
* Spreading workloads across clouds reduce risks vs a mono-cloud approach
* Using different clouds may reduce costs in long term

## Developer Needs

* Developers have different needs from cloud providers depending on the developer’s experience
* Developers have specific use cases they have to implement
* Developers need a cloud or clouds that do not lock them in
* Developers need a cloud or clouds that will grow with their needs

* Three broad categories of needs:

### 1. Hybrid Cloud Deployment

* Running workloads across clouds (public and private)
* Running part(s) of their workloads locally --- data sensitive
* Moving workloads from one cloud to another for various needs, e.g., to increase security, reduce costs, and scale out

### 2. Cloud Tooling & Cloud Services

* Developers need clouds that have the tools to do their job, e.g., DevOps, CI/CD
* Developers need clouds that include the services to build what they need, e.g., Data, AI. Blockchain
* Developers need online development environment to get started fast

### 3. Solve Specific Use Cases

* Collection of 10 common use case
* For each use case we will give a description of the problem, sketch of the solution(s) and how to achieve it in a hybrid cloud fashion
* Additionally we will provide information for further details and deeper learning

## Goals

1. Comprehensive collection of learnings for hybrid developers
2. Content that is agnostic of cloud and show examples in both the IBM Cloud and other leading public clouds
3. Solutions an content focused on solving use cases that are common to hybrid developers
